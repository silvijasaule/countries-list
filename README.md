## Countries List

Countries List is a list of all countries in the world that displays country name, region, and area size.

## Description

Using https://restcountries.com free API, I made a visualized representation of countries that displays country name, region, and area size.

The user can sort countries alphabetically (ascending or descending) by name and filter countries that are in Oceania region or smaller than Lithuania.
